## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

3. **Announcements** - Stored in MongoDB with a title, message, optional start date, and required expiration date. A sample announcement is inserted when the announcements collection is empty.
